1. Data Connection:

    Connect Tableau to the dataset.

2. Data Exploration:

    Leverage Tableau's drag-and-drop interface to explore and clean the data.

    creat calculation matrix like TurnoverRatate 
      syntax: SUM(IIF([Attrition] = 'Yes', 1, 0)) / COUNTD([Employee Number]) * 100
     
    for job involment 
    CASE [Job Involvement]
          WHEN 1 THEN 'V.LOW'
          WHEN 2 THEN 'Low'
          WHEN 3 THEN 'High'
          WHEN 4 THEN 'V.high'
    END
    this type of code i use many place two manapulate data in string or we can say more understing format 
    
    i also calculade average job satisfaction and performance ratings.
3.  To calculate OverTime attrition i use OverTime field and count of attrition In donat chart 
   same thing i do for Bussiness travel over attrition and work life balance over attrition

4. i use string format job satisfaction calculation field( data convert into string format ) over turnoverRate
Same thing happend with jobinvolvement calculation field (data convert into string format ) over TurnoverRate 

5. i also use age field over TurnoverRate to identify attrition rate over age field age group of 20 is in higest attrition rate

6.i try to analysis jobRole over attrition rate
